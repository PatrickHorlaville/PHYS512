How to navigate this folder?

The document PS5_notebook.pdf accounts for all the work. Problem 1 is entirely solved as shown. Problem 2 lays out the solution and shows an example with only a few iterations. Same for Problem 3 and Problem 4. The code ran to get those results is from the PS5_code.py file. Then, the section Lot of Steps displays the same solutions but with a greater amount of steps (100 for the LM fitter and 1000 for the MCMC). The code ran to get those results is from the PS5_code_lot.py.
